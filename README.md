# Electronic Component

This is just a revisit of React. How does it feel after a year of Angular? How do they compare?

[See the demo!](https://interactive.guru/demo/electronic/)

I like both Angular and React for different reasons:

- React feels so simple and will let you do what you want and build quickly early. However, it can get out of hand quickly if not coordinating best practices with the team as a whole.
- Angular is such a pain to learn, however its opinionated nature helps keep things more cohesive out of the box. TypeScript is cool out of the box as well.
